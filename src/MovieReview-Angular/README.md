MovieReview-Angular - Beta version
===================

This Single Page App created using bunch of technologies. I have used ASP.NET MVC 5 as a base framework. With this I have used Web API, Entity Framework Code First Approach, Unit Of Work pattern, Repository Pattern and design techniques like Single Repository Principle, Factory pattern.... Apart from this I have used Angular framework to write the client side of the application and many out of the box things...  

For more information on the same you can refer article @ my blog http://myview.rahulnivi.net/glimpse-single-page-app-asp-net-mvc-5-angular/

Also, will be publishing step by step article on the same shortly.
